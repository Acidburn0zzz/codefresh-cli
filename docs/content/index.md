# Introduction

Welcome to the Kittn API! You can use our API to access Kittn API endpoints, which can get information on various cats, kittens, and breeds in our database.

We have language bindings in Shell, Ruby, and Python! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

**This example API documentation page was created with [DocuAPI](https://github.com/bep/docuapi/), a multilingual documentation theme for the static site generator [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/).**

# Kittens

## Get All Kittens

```cli
package main

import "github.com/bep/kittn/auth"

func main() {
	api := auth.Authorize("meowmeowmeow")

	_ = api.GetKittens()
}
```

> The above command returns JSON structured like this:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Fluffums",
    "breed": "calico",
    "fluffiness": 6,
    "cuteness": 7
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Max",
    "breed": "unknown",
    "fluffiness": 5,
    "cuteness": 10
  }
]
```

This endpoint retrieves all kittens.
