Codefresh CLI is developed and built with node.js. <br />

In case you have node.js installed on your machine you can use [NPM](/installation/npm) or [YARN](/installation/yarn) to install it.<br>

If you don't have node.js installed you can install the CLI by [Donwloading](/installation/download) it directly.<br />

It is also possible to run the CLI using a [Docker image](/installation/docker).
